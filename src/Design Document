LinearEquation.java = I will use this class to create methods.
Instance Variables:
     private int x1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input
     private int y1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input
     private int x2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
     private int y2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
     private String coord1 = stores coord1 to be printed
     private String coord2 = stores coord2 to be printed
     private double slope = stores the slope
     private double yInt = stores the y-int
     private String formula = stores the intercept formula
     private double distance = stores the distance between two points
 Constructor:
     public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2,String coord1, String coord2) = sets the coordinates of the points

 Methods:
     public String toString = uses the methods in the LinearEquation to set instance variables on top of the already constructed variables
     then, stores all required information as a string
     public double findSlope = finds the slope of the line using slope formula
     public String findFormula = do x2-x1 and y2-y1 individually and then use instance variables to concatenate
     all the values. Slope will be the value of x2-x2 + "/" + value of y2-y1
     public double getYInt = use the same formula used in findFormula except isolate y-int and return the resulting value
     public double getDistance = will use the distance formula (will use Math.sqrt and Math.pow(value,2) methods) in order to find the distance
     public String calcY (double x) = will receive an input of x which will be used with the slope and y-int variable
     to calculate the y value by plugging x in the formula. returns the coordinate as strings
     (for all methods with a return type specified, I will return them so if use needs individual values, it's possible)
     (for all values that needs to be rounded I'll use the round method from the Math class(value*100.0)/100.0)




EquationRunner.java = I will use this class to run the methods in the code
import java.util.Scanner = I will need the scanner in order to ask for user input
Variables:
    int x1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input
    int y1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input
    int x2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
    int y2 = stores the stores the second x coordinate of the user input
    String coord1 = stores the first coordinate
    String coord2 = stores the second coordinate
    String transX3 = stores the third x value as a string to be converted
    double x3 = stores the third x value of the user input as a double
Objects
    LinearEquation idk = new LinearEquation(x1,y1,x2,y2,coord1,coord2) = creates idk as a new object of the LinearEquation class
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in) = creates a new scanner object in order to receive user input
Methods:
    use System.out.println to ask for user input
    nextLine() in order to store user input
    use indexOf method to calculate the index of , so we can extract the coordinates
    use length method to calculate the last index of the string coordinates to remove )
    use subString method in order to extract the needed coordinates
    use parseInt() in order to convert input into integer
    use System.out.println(idk) in order to print information of the object
    use parseDouble() in order to convert the last input into double
    use System.out.print("Solved coordinate point is: " + idk.calcY(x3)) in order to print the last requirement of the program
