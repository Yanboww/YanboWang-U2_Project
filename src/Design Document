LinearEquation.java = I will use this class to create methods.
Instance Variables:
     private int x1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input
     private int y1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input
     private int x2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
     private int y2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
     private String formula = stores the intercept formula as a string
     private double slope = stores the slope of the line passing through the points
     private double yInt = stores the y intercept of the line passing through the points
     private double distance = distance of the two points
 Constructor:
     public LinearEquation(int x1, int y2, int x2, int y2) = sets the coordinates of the points
 Methods:
     public String toString = stores the instance formula into strings that can be printed to show information
     (including the points inputted by the user)
     public double findSlope = finds the slope of the line using slope formula
     public String findFormula = finds formula by first finding the slope, plugging in the coordinates and then
     concatenate then with a slope converted into fraction
     public double yInt = use the same formula used in findFormula except only returning the y-int
     public double distance = will use the distance formula (will use math methods) in order to find the distance
     public String calcY (double x) = will receive an input of x which will be used with the slope and y-int variable
     to calculate the y value. returns the coordinate as strings
     (for all methods with a return type specified, I will return them)
     (for all values that needs to be rounded I'll use the round method from the Math class)

EquationRunner.java = I will use this class to run the methods in the code
import java.util.Scanner = I will need the scanner in order to ask for user input
Variables:
int x1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input
int y1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input
int x2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
int y2 = stores the stores the second x coordinate of the user input
String transX1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input as a string to be converted
String transY1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input as a string to be converted
String transX2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input as a string to be converted
String transY2 = stores the stores the second x coordinate of the user input as a string to be converted
double x3 = stores the third x value of the user input
String transX3 = stores the third x value of the user input as string to be conveted
Objects
LinearEquation idk = new LinearEquation(x1,y1,x2,y2) = creates a idk as a new object of the LinearEquation class
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in) = creates a new scanner object in order to receive user input
Methods:
use System.out.println to ask for user input
nextLine() in order to store user input
use parseInt() in order to convert input into integer
use System.out.println(idk) in order to print information of the object
use parseDouble() in order to convert the last input into double
use System.out.print("Solved coordinate point is: " + idk.calcY(x3)) in order to print the last requirement of the program
