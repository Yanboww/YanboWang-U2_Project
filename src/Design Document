LinearEquation.java = I will use this class to create methods.
Instance Variables:
     private int x1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input
     private int y1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input
     private int x2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
     private int y2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
     private String formula = stores the intercept formula as a string
     private double slope = stores the slope of the line passing through the points
     private double yInt = stores the y intercept of the line passing through the points
     private double distance = distance of the two points
 Constructor:
     public LinearEquation(int x1, int y2, int x2, int y2) = sets the coordinates of the points
 Methods:
     public String toString = stores the instance formula into strings that can be printed to show information
     (including the points inputted by the user)
     public double findSlope = finds the slope of the line using slope formula
     public String findFormula = finds formula by first finding the slope, plugging in the coordinates and then
     concatenate then with a slope converted into fraction
     public double yInt = use the same formula used in findFormula except only returning the y-int
     public double distance = will use the distance formula (will use math methods) in order to find the distance
     public String calcY (double x) = will receive an input of x which will be used with the slope and y-int variable
     to calculate the y value. returns the coordinate as strings
     (for all methods with a return type specified, I will return them)
     (for all values that needs to be rounded I'll use the round method from the Math class)

EquationRunner.java = I will use this class to run the methods in the code
import java.util.Scanner = I will need the scanner in order to ask for user input
Variables:
int x1 = stores the first x coordinate of the user input
int y1 = stores the first y coordinate of the user input
int x2 = stores the second x coordinate of the user input
int y2 = stores the stores the second x coordinate of the user input
double x3 = stores the third x value of the user input
Objects
LinearEquation idk = new LinearEquation(x1,y1,x2,y2) = creates a idk as a new object of the LinearEquation class
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in) =
